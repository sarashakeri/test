iiiiThe folder kubeadm-cluster contains the master.sh and slave.sh scripts. These are used to configure and setup the master and slave nodes. Note that IP address needs to be changed before running the kubeadm command as described below.

Edit /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf so that the KUBELET_KUBECONFIG_ARGS contain the --node-ip to set what ip address the node should use for internal cluster communication
